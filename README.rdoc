= THIS IS A REAL WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a macruby app that demonstrates the use of zxing to decode QR codes.

I used it to play with macruby and to do some prototyping of
zxing-based stuff.

It has it's own packaging stuff which might be (out)dated.

It needs libicns.

You need to have macruby installed. I use rvm and macruby-nightly. You
need to have xcode installed.

Clone the repo, then 

Feel free to submit patches and/or other contrbutions.
